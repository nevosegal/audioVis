# audioVis

An audio visualisation app based on [sndpeek](http://soundlab.cs.princeton.edu/software/sndpeek/).
In order to compile and run this project, place the whole folder inside the apps folder in the openFrameworks directory.
Feel free to change the frequency of the oscillator by dragging the mouse up and down.
**By default, the audio input is set on microphone, so be sure to wear headphones to prevent feedback!**
